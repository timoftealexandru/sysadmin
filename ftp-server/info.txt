How to add user
Uses virtual users (not real linux users).

Open container terminal
pure-pw useradd bob -u ftpuser -d /home/ftpusers/bob
pure-pw mkdb
No restart should be needed. More info on usage here: https://download.pureftpd.org/pure-ftpd/doc/README.Virtual-Users

Connection test
$ ftp -p localhost 21
ftp> user bob
ftp> ls
Restoration from backup
Container can be backed up and restored using dockup image. Stored files must have correct ownership ftpuser:ftpgroup, otherwise FTP write fails on permissions.

get into the container docker exec -t [containerid] bash
cd /home/ftpusers
chown ftpuser:ftpgroup -R *
Issues
Does not support TLS (needs configuration)
